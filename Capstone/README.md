This project serves as an example of a solution of binary classification problem.

The folder contains csv files which contain data on customer level. It also contains Jupyter notebooks with fullly executionable code.
In case you want to reproduce results locally, you may fork the project and update the names of the csv files in the notebook with the names downloaded from the project.

Finally, project_report in PDF format tells details of the problem, its background and solution, along with intermediate steps.

Optionally, there is also proposal in PDF which can be considered prequel to the project.
